TOP LEVEL: 

    fused_reg.py: this file contains core code for fitting fused linear models for gene regulatory networks. Things that are here are
    -code for solving grn
	-any data structures needed to solve grn
	-code for generating/manipulating constraints from data
		
    data_sources.py: this file is a list of classes implementing a data_source interface. Also contains code for generating synthetic data, which should be saved to files and then dealt with as data in a standard format. data_sources does the following
    -return organism names
	-return (ordered) gene names for each organism
	-return (ordered) tf names for each organism
	-return expression matrices for each organism
	-return tf expression matrices for each organism
	-return orthology lists
	-return priors
	
    fit_grn.py: this file contains
    -code for fitting various grn models given data sources
	-code for manipulating data
	-code for evaluating network performance
	-code for cross-validation
	-code for parameter-estimation


    examples.py: this file contains two examples for running fused regression, one with synthetic data and one using the bacterial dataset
